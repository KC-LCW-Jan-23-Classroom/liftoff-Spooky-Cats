Worksheet Link - Group Expectations Worksheet

Setting Group Expectations
You’ll need either a Miro board or a Jamboard set up for this activity. Each member should put sticky notes on the slides that you’re working on.
Slides
1. What is something that you need to be successful during Unit 3?
* Communication
* Ask for help when needed
* Be able to lean on each other
* Honesty
2. What’s important for you when you work in groups?
* Direct communication
3. What’s something that you are worried about for Unit 3?
   * Finding a good time for everyone to meet.
   * Everyone pulling their weight


After you’ve spent some time talking through the sticky notes, create a list of the expectations that your group has for their project and how they’ll work together.
Expectations that we recommend also having for your group
* Ask for help when needed
* Be willing to help each other instead of displaying an “it’s not my job” attitude
* Be flexible to assist with group needs
* Consistently communicate about where you are at with the project
* Attend all group meetings, communicating if you need to miss a class ahead of time
* Treat it like a job, not like a typical group project
   * We will be working on a project that may mimic how you will work on a dev model.addAttribute("employers", employerRepository.findAll());
   *         model.addAttribute("skills", skillRepository.findAll());team
   * If you consistently do not show up to work or are not doing the tasks that you committed to completing, you may be removed from the course.
